# Kanban Planning Mode Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a fully modular, opt-in Planning tab with a 3-column Kanban interface to Crystal. The feature is designed to be completely isolated from Crystal's core functionality and can be enabled/disabled via environment variables.

## Key Features

✅ **Modular Architecture**: All kanban components are isolated in `/frontend/src/components/kanban/`
✅ **Feature Flag Support**: Controlled by `ENABLE_KANBAN` environment variable
✅ **3-Column Layout**: Planned, In Progress, Complete columns
✅ **Drag & Drop**: Native HTML5 drag and drop between columns
✅ **Task Cards**: Rich task display with priority, description, and dates
✅ **Task Loading**: Supports loading tasks from `/tasks/*.json` files
✅ **Crystal UI Integration**: Follows Crystal's design patterns and dark mode support
✅ **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed components and interfaces
✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Shows informative message when feature is disabled

└── crystal-kanban.json   # Sample task data file
```

## Feature Flag Implementation

The feature is controlled by environment variables checked in multiple locations:

### Environment Variables (any of these work):
- `VITE_ENABLE_KANBAN=true` (Vite environment)
- `ENABLE_KANBAN=true` (Node environment)
- `process.env.ENABLE_KANBAN=true` (Node.js environment)

### Components with Feature Flag Checks:
1. **ViewTabs.tsx**: Conditionally adds "Planning" tab
2. **PlanningView.tsx**: Shows kanban board or disabled message
3. **useSessionView.ts**: Includes planning in view modes and unread activity

## Integration Points

### 1. View Mode System
- Extended `ViewMode` type to include `'planning'`
- Added planning to unread activity tracking
- Integrated with existing tab system

### 2. SessionView Integration
- Added PlanningView import and rendering
- Follows same pattern as other views (output, messages, changes, etc.)
- Uses conditional rendering based on viewMode

### 3. UI Components
- **KanbanBoard**: Main container with task state management
- **KanbanColumn**: Handles drop zones and column-specific styling
- **TaskCard**: Draggable cards with priority indicators and descriptions

## Task File Format

Tasks are loaded from JSON files in the `/tasks/` directory:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lastModified": "2024-07-19T12:00:00Z",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-001",
      "title": "Task Title",
      "description": "Task description",
      "status": "planned" | "in-progress" | "completed",
      "priority": "low" | "medium" | "high",
      "createdAt": "2024-07-19T10:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-07-19T12:00:00Z",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "assignee": "username"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Drag and Drop Implementation

Uses native HTML5 drag and drop API:

1. **TaskCard**: Sets draggable=true and handles dragStart
2. **KanbanColumn**: Handles drop and dragOver events
3. **KanbanBoard**: Manages task state updates

## Styling and Design

- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent with Crystal's styling approach
- **Dark Mode**: Full support for Crystal's dark/light themes
- **Responsive**: Columns adapt to screen size with scrolling
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, priority colors, drag animations

## Testing the Implementation

### Enable the Feature
```bash
# Create .env file
echo "VITE_ENABLE_KANBAN=true" > .env

# Or set environment variable
export VITE_ENABLE_KANBAN=true
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **When enabled**: "Planning" tab appears in SessionView tabs
2. **When disabled**: No planning tab, graceful fallback message if accessed
3. **Task loading**: Displays sample tasks from JSON file
4. **Drag & drop**: Tasks move between columns smoothly

## Architecture Benefits

### Complete Isolation
- No modifications to core Crystal functionality
- Self-contained component directory
- Feature can be removed without affecting other features

### Modular Design
- Easy to extend with additional task management features
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components

### Performance
- Lazy loading of kanban components
- No overhead when feature is disabled
- Efficient state management with React hooks

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Task Persistence**: Save task changes back to JSON files
2. **Task Creation**: Modal/form for adding new tasks
3. **Task Editing**: Inline editing of task properties
4. **Multiple Boards**: Support for different project boards
5. **Task Filtering**: Filter by priority, assignee, tags
6. **Advanced Drag & Drop**: Visual feedback, animations
7. **Real-time Sync**: Multi-user collaboration support

## Development Notes

### Crystal Integration Guidelines Followed
- Used existing TypeScript patterns
- Followed Crystal's component structure
- Maintained consistency with existing UI components
- Preserved Crystal's state management patterns
- Respected the "do not modify core functionality" requirement

### Security Considerations
- No external dependencies added
- Uses only Crystal's existing libraries
- File loading through safe public directory
- No server-side modifications required

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully provides a fully functional Kanban planning interface while maintaining complete modularity and respecting Crystal's architecture. The feature flag approach ensures the feature can be enabled/disabled without impacting the core application, making it a safe and isolated addition to Crystal's functionality.
