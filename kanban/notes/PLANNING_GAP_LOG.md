# PLANNING GAP LOG

## Problem
I was trying to use the Kanban planning system to plan tasks that would finish building the system itself. But the Kanban UI and session integrations only live across worktrees.

## Consequence
This created cognitive load — I was forced to hold task structure, integration needs, and feature states in memory. I couldn't see progress visually or use Claude to manage prompts because the system wasn't active.

## Resolution
Need to merge all known-good worktrees into main to bring Kanban system fully online.

## Key Insight
⚠️ **Pre-bootstrap state**: The system is built *across branches*, but until it's **unified in `main` and running**, you can't:
* Launch the Planning tab and see real task status
* Run the app in each worktree without duplication
* Use Claude recursively on live tasks
* See test coverage % tied to task completion

## Next Steps
1. **Merge validated branches into main**:
   - `feature/kanban-planning-mode`
   - `feature/task-loader`
   - `feature/session-bridge`
   - `feature/sample-task-runner`
   - `test/kanban-ui-tests`

2. **Test unified system**:
   ```bash
   ENABLE_KANBAN=true NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm build
   pnpm electron-dev
   ```

3. **Resume recursive planning**: Once merged, use the actual Kanban UI to plan Phase 2

## Meta-Learning
Recursive systems need to reach **minimum viable recursion** before they can effectively plan their own enhancement. The validation phase proved the components work; now they need unification to achieve true self-orchestration.
